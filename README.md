Lower the use of plastic bottles by locating and tracking sources of free water for those who are less fortunate.  

Did you know water is only mentioned once throughout the entire constitution including the Bill of Rights.

It was not until 2010 that the United Nations voted to recognize “the right to safe and clean drinking water as a human right” but even then countries are only required to do their best.

With close to 550,000 Homeless people in the US we want to bring this issue to the forefront and pressure our government to recognize this as a major issue which is how we came up with H2O to Go.

###How does H2O to Go Work?
