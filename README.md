### Helping users stay in shape while supporting the human right to free and safe water. 

#
### Did you know 
    Water is only mentioned once throughout the entire constitution including the Bill of Rights.

    It was not until 2010 that the United Nations voted to recognize “the right to safe and clean drinking water as a human right” but even then countries are only required to do their best.

    With close to 550,000 Homeless people in the US we want to bring this issue to the forefront and help our communities with this pressing issue.
